PEER package source distribution.



***For the impatient***

Install instructions.
The peer installation tree is baed on cmake.

1) Create a target directory for the build tree
#   mkdir build
2) go to the build directory and call cmake
   cd build
#  cmake ./..
3) 
#   make 
#   make install


***Troubleshooting and further details***

Installing peer binaries:
If make is called with the "install" flag; the standard behviour is to install a peer binary and the peer C++ library to the system-wide targets.
Use "cmake ./.. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/my_software/peer" or equivalent to specify your own build target.

*Python module
The python module is not affected by CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX. Instead, cmake tries to build the python module and installs it using the python version which is int he path when using the command "python".
You can specify your own python binary by editing CMakeLists.txt
The python interface requires a recent numppy version to be present.

*R module
